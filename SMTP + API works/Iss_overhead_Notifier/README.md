# Hi there. 
It is said the ISS rotates the world more than 6 times daily 
**We wanna actually see**
And also spot in the sky maybe ... 

By using it's API we connect to the ISS and get it's current location .. 
Matching that with our location we can actually get if it's above us and with the Smtp module sned ourselves a mail so we can look up at that time and spot it 

The current codes send the mail when the ISS is overhead at night.. 
At least we won't have a sun blocking our veiw 😅

---
Happy coding to you ✌️
